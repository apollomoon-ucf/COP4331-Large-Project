# CourtneyGenix Fitness App

Team project for COP4331 (Processes for Object-Oriented Software Development) at UCF.

As a team, we were tasked with creating a MERN stack application in six weeks. For our project, we selected to work with a personal trainer, CourtneyGenix, who needed an application to help them manage their clients.

Our application gives personal trainers the ability to manage clients, create workouts and exercises, assign daily nutrition goals, and schedule workout plans on their client's calendar. A personal trainer's client can then log in to the app and view all of their workouts, exercixes, and goals.
